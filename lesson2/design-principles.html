            <h3>Trek Mountain Bikes</h3>
            <img src="images/trekMountainBikes.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Trek Mountain Bikes Website">
            <p>This Trek Mountain Bike website is a great example of Visual Hierarchy because the first
                thing you see is a large and majestic picture of the people having fun riding their bikes
                in the mountains. On top of the picture are two boxes, one white and one black. The white box catches
                your attention first and direct you to "Look at Bikes". The black box draws your attention
                next as it asks you if you want to "Learn More".

            <h3>DC Wonder Woman Run</h3>
            <img src="images/dcWonderWomanRun.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the DC Wonder Woman Website">
            <p>The DC Wonder Woman Website is a great example of Contrast because of its use of contrasting colors
                like Red, White, and Blue. The bright red, dark blue, and bright white have the ability to draw
                attention to different areas of the website because of their contrast. One example is the red "Register
                Now" button that is sitting on the blue background. It calls your attention because of the contrast
                between the two colors.

            <h2>Repetition</h2>

            <h3>Saratoga Springs City</h3>
            <img src="images/saratogaSpringsCity.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the Saratoga Springs City Website">
            <p>The Saratoga Springs City Website is a great example of repetition with its repeated use of the blue and
                gold color scheme and the small icons and lines that go down the page. Repetition helps create
                uniformity and gives the user an idea of what to expect.</p>
